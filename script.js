//What is the difference between var and let? 
//var you can redeclare let you can not 

//What is the difference between let and const? 
//let you can reassign where const you can not

//What is the difference between let and const? 
//let you can reassign how ever you can not redeclare; const can not be reassigned or redeclared

//What is hoisting?
//Hoisting declares all the var's first before the entire code base is loaded 

//if var PI = 3.14 is declared later in the code, PI will return undefined before it's decalred instead of giving a reference error
